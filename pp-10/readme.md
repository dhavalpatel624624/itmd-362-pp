# Production Problem 10: A/B Testing on the Cheap

## The Problem

Locate an interface component on a website that you use frequently that you think could be improved. The improvement should be minor.

Take a screenshot of the interface on both a mobile and desktop device. Then, sketch or illustrate your alternate/"b" test. Finally, describe modification and the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that you would need to write in order to conduct the test.

## Deliverables

* Screenshots of the interface component on mobile and desktop, placed in this directory (`pp-10/`)

* Sketch or illustrate (e.g., in Photoshop) your alternate/"b" test, placed in this directory (`pp-10/`)

* A text description of the modification, and a description of the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that you would need to write for the test (you do *not* have to write the actual HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, however)

NBA's website is extremely cluttered. There is blank dark blue line that just runs across the top of the page. This takes up a lot of space on a webpage. Also, this causes all the headline news, videos, and pictures underneath the nav bar to look really cluttered up. It seems that this is where the ads are supposed to go. So to remove this problem, I would change HTML to make this a hidden value. In JavaScript, only make this visible if there are sponsored ads otherwise make sure it remains hidden. Also, it's weird to have the ads pop up above the nav bar, it makes it the main focus for the website, which it shouldn't be. In HTML, put the div(bad, don't use div) somewhere else instead of the top. The mobile version as you can see, looks just fine because the ad is there and it shows up below the nav bar as it should be. The sketch justifies how the website should actually be layed out.
