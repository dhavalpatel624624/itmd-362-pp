# Production Problem 07: Implementing HCI guidelines for touchscreens

## The Problem

Using the HCI guidelines from either Apple/iOS, GNOME, or Windows, redesign the login page at
http://my.iit.edu/ for a touch-friendly environment. Use this to kickstart your work on Project 2.

**You only need to sketch your redesign**, and in the text below, reference at least three different
points of guidance from chosen HCI guidelines that went into your redesign sketches (you might
want to do multiple sketches, each highlighting a different feature of the same overall design).

## Resources

* Apple iOS HCI Guidlines:
  https://developer.apple.com/ios/human-interface-guidelines/overview/design-principles/
* Gnome Desktop:
  https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/design
* Windows Desktop Guidelines:
  https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/design

## Deliverables

Small commits to your Production Problems repository that include:

1) photographs of sketches of your new design, from your sketchbook
2) an explanation of three different points of guidance from your chosen guidelines (point to the
   specific URL where the guidance can be found) that you implemented in your sketch, written below:

* HCI Guidline One (URL): https://developer.apple.com/ios/human-interface-guidelines/ui-bars/search-bars/

* How you implemented it in your sketch: 
I added a search bar in the login page to help them also search for key things that may exist outside of MyIIT portal. Giving them the same feature that iit.edu would give them instead of going to the actual website.

* HCI Guidline Two (URL): https://developer.apple.com/ios/human-interface-guidelines/ui-controls/text-fields/
* How you implemented it in your sketch:
I will add input fields in the login page for username and password. The username will have a placeholder text for example: jdoe123. Even adding a "x" at the right end of the input fields to clear the entered text.

* HCI Guidline Three (URL): https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dn742488(v=vs.85).aspx
* How you implemented it in your sketch:
I will add icons appropriate for error messages. When a user tries to login with a missing field, there will be a ! icon asking them enter a value for the required field.
Although this isn't in the sketch, when a user enters a wrong username or password, there would be a X icon stating the error in red text, as illustreated in the guidelines.
