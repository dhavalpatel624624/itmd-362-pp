# Production Problem 09: Usability Checklists

## The Problem

Usability checklists are typical, and sometimes mindless, tools/magic tricks used to find usability problems in web and other digital projects. What you are going to do for this Production Problem is to locate at least 2 different usability checklists of at least 25 items (use Google, but challenge yourself to go beyond the first page of results). From those lists, create your own, condensed list of exactly ten items. Share with your group for Project 3 to help yourselves create your own master usability checklist.

## Deliverables

* URLs for the usability checklists you've found:

1. http://www.businessknowhow.com/marketing/webchecklist.htm 
2. http://www.keepitusable.com/keepitusable-mobile-app-usability-checklist.pdf

* Your own condensed, ten-item must-have usability checklist:

1. Easy to Navigate
2. Minimalist design - excess features removed (removing irrelevant information from the site)
3. Colours used provide good contrast and readability
4. Icons are clear to understand - no ambiguity (proper icons for paying with Paypal, credit card, or bank)
5. Error messages are free of technical language
6. Can visitors quickly tell what you do when they land on your site?
7. Is the design responsive so it looks good on tablets and smartphones too?
8. Are most important elements of the site visible without scrolling up and down or side to side on a laptop screen?
9. Number of links and buttons are reasonable
10. Clear and consistent way to go back to every screen
