# Production Problem 08: Emotional Design Hunt

## The Problem

First, read the assigned reading from Donald Norman, listed on the ITMD 362 syllabus.

Then, locate a physical object that you use regularly in your life (does not have to be an electronic or digital object), take a photograph of it, and identify in a sentence or two its visceral, behavioral, and reflective levels of emotional design. Then, develop a list of three qualities in that object’s emotional design that your group might use in your MyIIT redesign project. Be sure to share these with your group.

## Deliverables

A. Photograph of the object (place in the pp-09/ directory and commit).

B. Emotional design levels of your object:

* Visceral: When you first think of a pillow, you think about being able to put your head on it to sink into it. It relaxes you just imagining yourself using it. That would be a subconscious feeling of a pillow.

* Behavioral: The pillow is soft and fluffy as we imagine it. Its the one thing you always want when you're in your bed. It's YOUR pillow, it smells like home and feels like a cuddle buddy you never want to let go of. You get attached to it because of how often you use it.

* Reflective: Now imagine you go to friend's house and don't have your own pillow with you or don't have a pillow at all. You toss and turn missing the feeling of being on that pillow, that smell you are so familiar with, and fluffyness that give you so much comfort.

C.  Emotional design qualities of the object that might be useful for Project 2 MyIIT redesign:

1. The design of the website should look familiar to what users are used to from college websites and be similar to the iit.edu site.
2. The users should feel comfortable being able to use MyIIT without feeling lost and the features it has to offer. 
3. The users should have a need to come back to the site and be able to remember where everything is like its second nature to them. Simplicity.
